<h2>Participation Information</h2>
<h3>Task 2: Song Score Prediction</h3>
<p>
Dear participant,<br><br>
You are a senior data and content strategy manager at Spotify. It is early 2014, and the firm is considering acquiring a music intelligence AI tool. Echo Nest claims to offer a perfect solution: a model that predicts the future song performance based on playlist inclusion data, external signals like Shazam counts, and social media performance.
</p>
<p>
The CEO tasks you with evaluating this technology for potential adoption. To do this, you will be given data on a song, and you should evaluate its average weighted performance score (from 1.0 to 100.0). Afterwards, you will see the model’s prediction and must decide whether to maintain or revise your estimate.
</p>
<p>
Be critical — adopting this model could influence playlist curation, promotional strategy, and the visibility of thousands of artists. Rejecting it could mean missing opportunities to enhance playlists and forecasting capabilities. The model is not perfect; it has an accuracy of 86%.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, you are responsible for evaluating its usefulness and making a well-justified decision. Your assessment may also influence how much confidence leadership places in your judgment.
</p>

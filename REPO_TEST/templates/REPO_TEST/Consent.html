<h3>Participant Information and Consent</h3>

<p>Dear participant,</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in our study. This page provides detailed guidance for participation in the study. Please read it carefully before you begin.</p>

<h4>Content of the Experiment</h4>
<p>In this study, you will complete two short tasks involving decision-making with and without AI support.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Task 1: Income Category Estimation</strong><br>
        You will receive information about a real person (e.g., job type, education level, marital status) and estimate whether they belong to a Low, Middle, or High income bracket. This task also includes 3 rounds. As with Task 1, you will see an AI recommendation after your initial estimate and can revise your response.<br>
        <em>Note: The model’s accuracy in this task is 72%.</em>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Task 2: Music Chart Prediction</strong><br>
        You will receive information about a song (e.g., genre, artist, release date) and estimate its position on the music charts (1–100). You will complete 3 rounds. After each initial estimate, you will see a recommendation from a trained AI model. You may adjust your estimate based on the model’s suggestion.<br>
        <em>Note: The model is not perfect and has an accuracy of 86%.</em>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4>
